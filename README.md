**cldr**

With the **cldr** package it‚Äôs now possible to get **cldr** (*Common Locale
Data Repository*) data to support your own localization efforts. This package
provides up-to-date datasets from the Unicode's CLDR repositories, and, as an
added bonus, functions to extract elements and subelements in a locale-specific
way!

The included datasets are:

- `all_locales`
- `default_locales`
- `locale_names`
- `numbers`
- `dates`
- `currencies`
- `characters`
- `character_labels`

And the nice-to-have functions are:

- `cldr_locale_names()`
- `cldr_numbers()`
- `cldr_dates()`
- `cldr_currency()`
- `cldr_characters()`
- `cldr_character_labels()`
