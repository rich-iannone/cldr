With the **cldr** package it‚Äôs possible to get **cldr** (*Common Locale
Data Repository*) data to support your own localization efforts. This package
provides up-to-date datasets from the Unicode's CLDR repositories, and, as an
added bonus, functions to extract elements and sub-elements in a locale-specific
way!

The included datasets are:

- `all_locales`
- `default_locales`
- `locale_names`
- `numbers`
- `dates`
- `currencies`
- `characters`
- `character_labels`

And the nice-to-have functions are:

- `cldr_locale_names()`
- `cldr_numbers()`
- `cldr_dates()`
- `cldr_currencies()`
- `cldr_characters()`
- `cldr_character_labels()`

## EXAMPLES

If you need to get the decimal mark and grouping separators for the base German
locale `"de"`, then the `cldr_numbers()` function could be used:

```r
cldr_numbers(locale = "de", element = numbers_elements$decimal)
```
```
#> [1] ","
```

```r
cldr_numbers(locale = "de", element = numbers_elements$group)
```
```
#> [1] ","
```

Need to know the `"LU"` territory name from the `"es"` locale?

```r
cldr_locale_names(locale = "es", element = locale_names_elements$territory_names)$LU
```
```
#> [1] "Luxemburgo"
```

Want a list of days-of-the-week names in the `"ko"` locale?

```r
cldr_dates(locale = "ko", element = dates_elements$days_standalone_wide)
```
```
#> $sun
#> [1] "ÏùºÏöîÏùº"
#> 
#> $mon
#> [1] "ÏõîÏöîÏùº"
#> 
#> $tue
#> [1] "ÌôîÏöîÏùº"
#> 
#> $wed
#> [1] "ÏàòÏöîÏùº"
#> 
#> $thu
#> [1] "Î™©ÏöîÏùº"
#> 
#> $fri
#> [1] "Í∏àÏöîÏùº"
#> 
#> $sat
#> [1] "ÌÜ†ÏöîÏùº"
```

Need to get the appropriate display name for the the Japanese Yen (`"JPY"`)
currency while in the `"zh"` locale?

```r
cldr_currencies(
  locale = "zh",
  currency = currency_codes$JPY,
  element = currencies_elements$currency_display_name
)
```
```
#> [1] "Êó•ÂÖÉ"
```

Would you like the complete set of exemplar characters for the `"fi"` locale?

```r
cldr_characters(locale = "fr", element = characters_elements$exemplar_characters)
```
```
#> [1] "[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s ≈° t u v w x y z ≈æ √• √§ √∂]"
```

This is just a small sampling of ways you can easily get at all the data
within the CLDR while using **R**!
