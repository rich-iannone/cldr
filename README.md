**cldr**

With the **cldr** package it’s now possible to get **cldr** (*Common Locale
Data Repository*) data to support your own localization efforts. This package
provides up-to-date datasets from the Unicode's CLDR repositories, and, as an
added bonus, functions to extract elements and subelements in a locale-specific
way!
